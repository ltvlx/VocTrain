# VocTrain
Tool which helps to learn new foreign words 

Give it an input vocabulary in a form of Excel table.
Then, by a means of a simple user interface the program will suggest you random words from your vocabulary.
Words that you failed to name correctly have a higher probability to be suggested to you.


### Plans for future:
* Get rid of adding correct/incorrect information into tables by hand.
* Make output for additional information of word
* In case of incorrect answer, force user to write word correctly
* Add different modes of learning (revise all words, train badly-known words, ...)
